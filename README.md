# Salifort-Motors-Employee-Retention-Analysis
This project focuses on understanding and predicting employee turnover at Salifort Motors using data analytics and machine learning. Employee turnover is a costly problem for many companies, and reducing it can save money and improve workplace morale. Our goal is to analyze the company’s employee data to find the main reasons why people leave and build a model that predicts who might leave in the future.

What We Did
* Data Exploration: We examined the dataset containing employee details like job satisfaction, salary levels, promotion history, department, work accidents, and whether they left the company.

* Data Preparation: We cleaned the data and prepared it for modeling by selecting predictor variables and the target outcome (whether an employee left).

* Modeling: We used logistic regression to predict employee turnover because it’s a simple yet effective method for classification problems.

* Results Interpretation: We looked at which factors had the biggest influence on turnover. For example, satisfaction level was by far the strongest factor. High salary and recent promotions also helped keep employees.

* Surprising Findings: We found that employees who had work accidents were less likely to leave, which suggests possible support systems in place but needs further investigation.

* Recommendations: Based on the findings, we suggested the company focus on improving employee satisfaction, reviewing salary structures, promoting growth opportunities, and strengthening support programs.

Why This Matters
* Reducing employee turnover saves the company money and helps keep experienced workers who contribute to success. By predicting who might leave, Salifort Motors can intervene early with targeted actions to retain valuable employees.

How to Use This Project
* Review the data analysis and modeling code in the provided notebook/script.

* Use the model to score new employee data and identify those at higher risk of leaving.

* Implement the recommendations to improve retention strategies.

* Update the model periodically with new data to keep predictions accurate.
